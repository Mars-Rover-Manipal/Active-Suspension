## 2. Holding Torque

* For now a certain preset has been chosen, which is bound to vary:

      rosrun lsd holding_torque.py
      
## 3. Reading the link angles of the motors:

* Here, a template script has been created, that extracts the pitch angles of all the 4 motors from the `/gazebo/link_states` topic:

      rosrun lsd link_angles.py
